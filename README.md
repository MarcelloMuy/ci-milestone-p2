# Simon Game Project

## Introduction
  Welcome to my second milestone project which focuses on the JavaScript language. This project is a browser version of the retro game Simon. 
  Simon is a memory game where the program flashes a series of lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
  If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. 
  The game is over if the user fails to repeat the correct pattern or if the user complete 10 rounds, winning the game.

  A live version of the game can be found [here](https://marcellomuy.github.io/ci-milestone-p2/).

# 1. User experience (UX) design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
  
  This website was designed to be simple and easy to navigate with large buttons, clear text and high contrast between colours. Instructions buttons were added to guide the user on how to play the game. It also contains a feedback button giving the user the ability to contact the creator of the game.

## 1.1 User Goals
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  As a user I expect:
  * A website that is responsive to different screens sizes.
  * Clear instructions on how to play. 
  * Ability to restart the game at any time.
  * Be able to check which round I am on.
  * Be able to navigate the game without reloading the page.
  * A game that increases the speed after few rounds.
  * An option to play with no sound.

  Two fonts were used for this design. 'Press Start 2p'  for logo and Montserrat for the other elements, Sans Serif was used as a backup font in both cases.

  The only difference between the mobile and desktop versions is that on desktop a container is added around game and a gif image added as a background. The game, buttons and content are displayed in the same format as de mobile version.
  
  The desktop version wireframe is presented below.
